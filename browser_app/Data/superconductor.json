She is also the host of the Hell or High Water podcast. If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. If you believe the hype, LK-99 could be revolutionary. It\u2019s supposed to be a perfect superconductor that could help nuclear fusion become a reality and make levitating trains an easy way to commute. At least that\u2019s the story that\u2019s drummed up on social media \u2014 but it\u2019s not what many experts think of the new discovery. The frenzy has picked up steam on Twitter (which is currently rebranding to X), Twitch, and Reddit, where LK-99 has been heralded as the physics breakthrough of a lifetime. Academic researchers and eager amateurs alike are racing to see if LK-99 is legit by making it themselves. That way, they can figure out if LK-99 really has the superpowers that the researchers who first discovered it wrote about in controversial papers they published in July. That\u2019s the story that\u2019s drummed up on social media \u2014  but it\u2019s not what many experts think The Verge spoke with a handful of experts in the field to try to sort the science from the hype. As much as they might love to see this kind of superconductor be successful \u2014 one that can conduct electricity with zero resistance in room temperature and ambient pressure \u2014 they\u2019re skeptical. To be sure, we\u2019re still waiting for more definitive answers from everyone trying to verify the claims about LK-99. The Verge also wanted to know \u2014 if LK-99 actually does what it\u2019s supposed to \u2014 what comes next? Back up, what is LK-99? It may look like any old dark gray rock, but technically, LK-99 is a polycrystalline material made out of lead, oxygen, and phosphorus that\u2019s been \u201cdoped\u201d \u2014 or infused \u2014 with copper.\u00a0A group of researchers kicked off a frenzy in late July when they published a set of papers about the discovery of LK-99 and called it \u201ca brand-new historical event that opens a new era for humankind.\u201d The papers, with lead authors from the Quantum Energy Research Centre in South Korea, claim that LK-99 is the world\u2019s first room-temperature ambient-pressure superconductor. In other words, it can conduct electricity without any resistance in a typical setting. To go Sith Lord on the topic, eliminating resistance is everything. Power grids and electronics waste tons of electricity today because of resistance in less efficient materials. Why is LK-99 potentially so important? There are other superconductors today. They\u2019re used in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machines, quantum computers, and nuclear fusion devices. But those superconductors only work under very low temperatures or high pressures. That makes them too difficult and expensive to use in most everyday applications. \u201cA technologically viable room-temperature superconductor isn\u2019t just Nobel Prize territory. If you\u2019ve patented it, it\u2019s incalculable value essentially,\u201d says Chris Grovenor, professor of materials at the University of Oxford and director of the Centre for Applied Superconductivity. \u201cIt\u2019s transformational on so many things.\u201d \u201cA technologically viable room-temperature superconductor isn\u2019t just Nobel Prize territory. If you\u2019ve patented it, it\u2019s incalculable value essentially.\u201d Why has the scientific community reacted with skepticism? To start, LK-99 rose to fame after it was described in preprints, research papers that haven\u2019t been subject to peer review. The gold standard, more or less, for new research is to be published in a reputable peer-reviewed journal. Two preprints were published in late July on the server arXiv, and a related study was published in the Journal of the Korean Crystal Growth and Crystal Technology earlier this year. That makes the efforts we\u2019re seeing now to try to duplicate the findings in those preprints crucial. But that isn\u2019t the only issue that gives experts pause. They raised a range of concerns in interviews with The Verge. To start, there were inconsistencies in the data; the two preprints disagree with each other. There\u2019s reportedly also conflict between the authors (there are three authors named on one paper and six on the other). The preprint with fewer authors contains \u201cmany defects,\u201d an author of the other paper told New Scientist. The author, William & Mary physics research professor Hyun-Tak Kim, also said that the preprint was uploaded to arXiv without his permission. Kim and other corresponding authors of the papers did not respond when The Verge reached out to them. Wait, there are more red (or at least yellow) flags\u2026 Grovenor points out that the researchers didn\u2019t perform a heat anomaly test that\u2019s standard for major laboratories studying these kinds of materials. \u201cAll superconductors that have ever been proven to be superconductors show this specific heat anomaly,\u201d he says. \u201cIf there is no specific heat anomaly, it ain\u2019t a superconductor.\u201d The preprints are also imprecise in their definition of \u201czero\u201d resistance, according to Nadya Mason, a condensed matter physicist at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Superconductors should have zero electrical resistance, but the preprints show \u201czero\u201d on a scale that makes it difficult to tell whether LK-99 is truly a perfect superconductor or just a very good conductor. \u201cMetal is a really, really, really, really, really good conductor,\u201d Mason says. But it\u2019s still not perfect. \u201cYou do lose a lot of energy in heat. That\u2019s why our laptops get hot and why you lose so much energy in the power grid. So it really matters whether you have a perfect conductor or a really good conductor.\u201d The building blocks for LK-99 raised some eyebrows, too. Unlike many superconductors made from metal, it starts out as a nonconducting mineral. \u201cWhen you start with a rock, chances are you will end with a rock,\u201d says Michael Norman, a distinguished fellow and former director of the materials science division at Argonne National Laboratory. Doping the material with copper is supposed to be what transforms it, but it\u2019s not clear where the copper is supposed to go and how it manages to transform the rock into a superconductor. \u201cThis discovery is completely out of the blue,\u201d says David Larbalestier, chief materials scientist of the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory and professor at FAMU-FSU College of Engineering. \u201cI have no idea what the idea, frankly, behind doping this [mineral] with copper was.\u201d Didn\u2019t we hear about some drama over a room-temperature superconductor before LK-99? There has indeed been a lot of drama. Back in 2020, a team of researchers from the University of Rochester said they had found a room-temperature superconductor made from hydrogen, sulfur, and carbon.\u00a0But the research, published in the prestigious journal Nature, was later retracted after editors pointed to issues with how the study\u2019s data was processed. \u201cIt makes most of us very, very wary of claims and cases where people can\u2019t reproduce their data\u201d The Rochester researchers tried again. In March, they published another paper on a room-temperature superconductor made from nitrogen, hydrogen, and the rare earth metal lutetium. They called it \u201creddmatter\u201d after a fictional material in Star Trek that forms black holes. That paper is still under scrutiny, especially since one of the key researchers from Rochester faces separate allegations of plagiarism and data fabrication in his other work. \u201cThat\u2019s just not good for the field. And it makes most of us very, very wary of claims and cases where people can\u2019t reproduce their data.\u201d Mason says. \u201cScience works by reproduction and by our ability to be open with each other and test each other\u2019s results.\u201d How successful have efforts been to replicate LK-99 and show whether it\u2019s superconducting? It\u2019s not just big research labs that are working to see whether LK-99 can live up to the hype. Since LK-99 is made from relatively simple ingredients and doesn\u2019t require extreme temperatures or pressures, other folks with access to it and the right equipment are trying their hand. An engineer at a space research startup has been livestreaming his efforts on Twitch, Wired reported this week (it was offline when The Verge tried to tune in). Experts tell The Verge it\u2019s still too soon to make a final call on LK-99. Nevertheless, some early results have captured people\u2019s imaginations on social media. A video has been making the rounds online of a piece of LK-99, made by a research team from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, appearing to levitate. Floating when placed above a magnet is a sign of diamagnetism, when a material expels a magnetic field. It\u2019s a classic signature of a superconductor, through a phenomenon called the Meissner effect, and the authors who first wrote about LK-99 also included a video of it partially levitating. What\u2019s important to keep in mind is that levitation alone doesn\u2019t make something a superconductor. It still has to show zero electrical resistance in rigorous testing. Other things levitate because they\u2019re diamagnetic, like graphite, for example, and LK-99 might just turn out to be a new kind of diamagnetic material. Other preprints have since been published on arXiv from research groups that say they\u2019ve made samples of LK-99 and have not found it to be a superconductor at room temperature. Grovenor points to one from the CSIR-National Physical Laboratory in India that he says is \u201cgood quality and sensible.\u201d After Lawrence Berkeley materials scientist Sin\u00e9ad Griffin posted her own analysis on Twitter with a GIF of Barack Obama dropping a mic, other people interpreted the results as evidence that LK-99 might actually work as a superconductor. Only, that wasn\u2019t what Griffin was trying to say with the paper. \u201cTLDR: My paper did *not* prove nor give evidence of superconductivity,\u201d she later clarified. It merely said that the material showed promise if the copper was put in a specific place while doping LK-99, but that nothing special really happens if the copper is in the wrong place. Other big-name institutions have yet to share their results, including researchers at Argonne National Laboratory and FAMU-FSU College of Engineering. \u201cWithin a week or two, we\u2019re going to have 20, 30, 40, 50, or 100 labs that will have done various syntheses. So it\u2019s going to be clear pretty quickly,\u201d says Larbalestier. What if LK-99 actually turns out to be a room-temperature superconductor? Is that going to change our lives right away? Let\u2019s say that, in a week or two, someone manages to cook up a batch of LK-99 that passes all the tests for superconductivity. What then? Well, that\u2019s still no guarantee that LK-99 will totally revolutionize everything electric. \u201cIf it can\u2019t be manufactured, it\u2019s a laboratory curiosity \u2014 one that will win a Nobel Prize \u2014 but it\u2019s still a curiosity. It\u2019s a really long way from a material which everybody can get excited about as a physics experiment to something which an engineer will say, \u2018Yes, I\u2019m going to buy that and put it in my machine,\u2019\u201d Grovenor says. \u201cThere are thousands of known superconductors \u2026 We use four because they\u2019re the ones that can be engineered, mass-produced, at a cost point which allows them to be applied in real systems that people will pay for,\u201d Grovenor says. \u201cIt may just be magic\u201d LK-99 could potentially be difficult to work with since it\u2019s a mineral rather than a malleable metal that you can wind as a wire, for instance. A big discovery in the 1980s led to superconductors that could work at higher temperatures than before, but it took longer to find real-world applications in part because the materials are brittle ceramic. So when might we see room-temperature superconductors in the real world? None of the experts The Verge spoke to could put an estimate on when we might be able to see revolutionary room-temperature superconductors in action. \u201cIt may just be magic, a magic unicorn and not exist,\u201d Grovenor says. \u201cWe have no right to expect that there are magic things out there.\u201d We could still potentially see some of the things that a room-temperature superconductor is supposed to usher in, even if it\u2019s never discovered. Think of perfectly efficient superconducting electricity grids and more powerful medical imaging machines. Those developments might\u00a0depend on more incremental improvements to make existing superconducting materials cheaper to manufacture and easier to deploy. \u201cThere are big improvements that can be made, but they\u2019re not with inventing a room-temperature superconductor,\u201d Grovenor says. \u201cThey\u2019re using the ones we have more effectively.\u201d / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.

I don\u2019t think people fully grasp the implications,\u201d a former Princeton physics undergraduate named Alex Kaplan tweeted. The tweet has since been viewed 30 million times. The video was attached to one of a pair of papers published by a team of researchers from South Korea on July 22 on the Arxiv preprint server, a site where scientists can post papers that haven\u2019t yet been through the peer-review vetting process. They described the results of experiments conducted with LK-99, a lab-made substance containing lead, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur. (The name derives from the initials of its inventors and the year they created it.) The levitation could be explained by the Meissner effect, a characteristic of materials that are superconducting, meaning they carry electrical current without any resistance. The authors made no bones about what they thought they\u2019d found, titling one of their reports \u201cThe First Room-Temperature Ambient-Pressure Superconductor.\u201d This was no modest claim; scientists have spent decades searching for a substance that is superconducting under normal, day-to-day conditions, and finding one would have a revolutionary impact on a wide range of industries. \u201cOur new development will be a brand-new historical event that opens a new era for humankind,\u201d the authors concluded. The story spread far and wide, from Twitter, Tik Tok, and Twitch to every mainstream publication. One of the science influencers touting LK-99\u2019s incredible potential was San Francisco\u2013based applied physicist Andrew Cote, who tweeted, \u201cif successful LK-99 would be a watershed moment for humanity easily on-par with invention of the transistor.\u201d His tweets, too, received millions of views. As the news spread, so did optimism. For a time, one online betting market was posting better-than-even odds that the superconductor claims would pan out. But would the findings prove replicable? Among working physicists and chemists, the mood was muted. \u201cThe scientific community is careful,\u201d says Leslie Schoop, a professor of chemistry at Princeton. \u201cThey\u2019re intrigued by what\u2019s going on, but I think that very few people actually think it could be room-temperature superconductivity.\u201d Superconductivity is a property of matter that can only be explained by quantum mechanics, the deeply weird \u201cnew physics\u201d whose elucidation was portrayed in the movie Oppenheimer. This kind of material has zero electrical resistance, meaning that if you induce a current to flow, it will keep on going forever. The first superconducting material was discovered in 1911, but to work it had to be cooled to negative 452 degrees Fahrenheit. Today, science has identified superconductors that operate at temperatures as warm as 95 degrees below zero, but only if they are held at extremely high pressures. Despite these limitations, superconductors already have practical applications. A 17-mile loop of superconducting magnets herds subatomic particles at the Large Hadron Collider near Geneva, and in Japan passengers can ride an experimental maglev train that runs along 25 miles of track at speeds of up to 375 miles per hour. But both of these require heavy infrastructure to keep the magnets cold. A superconductor that could operate at room temperature and pressure would be practical for a much wider variety of applications, including hypothetical fusion reactors creating abundant, clean energy and quantum computers capable of performing calculations that are virtually impossible using conventional processors. Lossless electricity transmission would make it a lot easier to connect cities to cheap renewable energy from far-off sources. Numerous claims of room-temperature superconductivity have been made in recent years, but none has so far stood up to scrutiny. LK-99 seemed more promising. After the Arxiv preprints were published, multiple teams around the world raced to replicate the findings by making samples of their own. Two teams were unsuccessful, but on August 1, Chinese researchers posted a video of a fleck of LK-99 material that they had created. The tiny speck, barely large enough to be visible, seemed to float above a magnet. Meanwhile, on July 31 a researcher at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California published a preprint on Arxiv asserting that theoretical calculations suggested that LK-99 might well be capable of exhibiting superconductivity. Nevertheless, there were grounds for caution. The findings had been released as preprints, meaning they hadn\u2019t passed peer review \u2014 an important mechanism to filter low-quality research from high-quality research. And there were other reasons to be skeptical. Physicists who work with superconductivity point out that superconductivity isn\u2019t the only way that materials can levitate in a magnetic field; there are plenty of substances that exhibit this property, called diamagnetism, including some that are used in desk toys. If LK-99 is a superconductor at room temperature, it will exhibit not only the Meissner effect and zero electrical resistance, but also a number of other characteristics. So far, these haven\u2019t been verified. And while the Chinese team found that their sample was superconductive, it turned out that this was the case only at temperatures of hundreds of degrees below zero. (This means that the diamagnetism demonstrated in their video must have been due to characteristics other than superconductivity.) This doesn\u2019t mean the case is closed; it\u2019s possible, for instance, that their sample was impure or improperly formulated, and that a more refined sample would perform better. As the week went on and strong confirmatory evidence failed to materialize, the online vibe seemed to wane, and the betting markets resumed their previous pessimism. \u201cI don\u2019t think there is anything to this, science-wise, in terms of it being a superconductor,\u201d says N. Peter Armitage, a professor of physics at Johns Hopkins. \u201cHistorically, there have been many, many reports of room-temperature superconductivity, but none have ever panned out. But I think it\u2019s important to have other groups independently investigate these claims, considering the potential impact.\u201d What Armitage finds most interesting about the story, he says, is \u201cthe story itself \u2014 it\u2019s interesting how such a tentative report has galvanized public imagination.\u201d Schoop agrees. \u201cThere is a lot of hype on social media that distorts the entire discussion,\u201d she says. \u201cThere are a few science influencers who come up with, like, \u2018This is going to change the world.\u2019 And I think it\u2019s just way too early to say that.\u201d Whatever properties LK-99 turns out to possess, its story so far is a reminder of why science is normally done in a slow, laborious way, with researchers carefully checking their work and running it by peers before unveiling it to the general public. Otherwise, the narrative is apt to get swept away by people who lack an expert perspective on what\u2019s going on. But ultimately, Schoop says, responsibility for the social-media frenzy lies with the authors of the LK-99 papers. \u201cThey should not have titled their preprint \u2018The First Room-Temperature Ambient-Pressure Superconductor,\u2019\u201d says Schoop. \u201cThat\u2019s on them.\u201d By submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice and to receive email correspondence from us.

Here\u2019s how it works. Laying another brick on the superconducting wall. If you're interested in making your own batch of the LK-99 superconducting material that's grabbed headlines around the world, you might be in for a shock at the complexity and nebulousness of the procedure. And as we'll detail below, you might also find difficulty sourcing some of the materials needed. If one person has stood among the eddies of the LK-99 superconductor drama as it happens in the US, that person is Andrew McCalip. The R&D engineer with California-based Varda Space Industries, McCalip has been at the forefront of public, independent replication efforts around the serendipitous superconductor, open-sourcing his work through Twitter and live-streaming the cooking process over Twitch - a relatively rare generosity. From his process, we can glean more information about the elusive LK-99 compound, its synthethization process, how difficult that process is in the face of restrictions around some of the required materials, and the somewhat \"spotty\" manufacturing process described in the original Korean paper. You can see his efforts in the two albums of images below. The main issue in replication stems from the cloudy process described in the original Korean paper \u2014 the documentation for making the material is incredibly vague. This fact is made evident by the buzz surrounding replication attempts, but it's also led to a veritable graveyard of failed samples in McCalip's possession. \n\nMaterials scientists will tell you that for baking processes, essential data include the temperature (at around 725 \u00ba C in a vacuum), how long it takes to bake, and what temperatures (the paper gives a baking time-band of 5-24 hours, which as you can imagine, introduces a lot of error), and the rate of quenching (that is, how fast should the samples' temperature be forced to drop). \n\nThe rate of quenching isn't even mentioned in the original Korean paper, leading McCalip (and other replicators, we imagine) to perform a sort of Russian roulette that's led to several differing, alien-looking samples of the LK-99 compound \u2014 and a number of broken ampules containing proto-attempts at synthesizing the compound. McCalip estimates that 2/3 of baked vials are rejects due to the lack of detailed information on the manufacturing process, a \"yield-wall\" that other researchers too will have to contend with. As we've dived into before, LK-99 is a compound that results from reacting lead sulfate with a copper-phosphorous compound. The ingredients are usually easy to commission \u2014 red phosphorus and copper to synthesize copper phosphide, and lead sulfate and lead oxide, which together form a mineral called lanarkite. \n\nAs it's currently understood, the addition of copper into the lanarkite baking process forces some of the lead atoms to be replaced by copper atoms in an unpredictable and currently incontrollable ratio. It seems that it's these copper atoms displacing lead that leads to LK-99's superconductive properties (due to the emergence of what are known as Fermi bands), manifested in the hallmark emergent magnetism (courtesy of the Meissner effect) and zero resistance to electrical conductivity (most of the drama surrounding LK-99 today surrounds its claimed room-temperature superconductivity not having yet been replicated, however). On perhaps a less optimistic note, however, it seems the frenzy around LK-99 - and its almost \"kitchen-counter\" manufacturing requirements have dried up an unsuspecting worldwide supply chain. As McCalip put it, it was relatively tough to secure one of the particular ingredients, red phosphorous, as it's a controlled substance that can also be used to synthesize morphine derivatives. But the combined brain power of Twitter devised that he could secure a shipment of copper phosphide (fewer synthetization steps) through a local California lab. According to him, he also managed to secure a supply from Poland before the supply dried up, a perhaps meaningful bit for the worldwide efforts to replicate and better understand LK-99. The relatively cheap and abundant base minerals mean it's unlikely they'll be long-term bottlenecks toward LK-99 manufacturing at scale (if that's the actual road we're on). But the worldwide supply chain isn't ready for sudden \"black swan\"-imposed demand jumps, which means that the current street price for Copper Phosphate has climbed precipitously towards the $20,000-per-kilogram ratio. There's a scenario where the mineral supply bottleneck could hinder research efforts; unfortunately, the world of minerals and chemistry is vulnerable to supply hoarders that aim to turn a quick profit, although it's a much more well-regulated arena than, say, GPU and game console purchases. Fortunately. In the end, McCalip and Varda's replication attempts resulted in a small, unsuspecting flake of LK-99 showcasing the same Meissner-effect-induced magnetic levitation \u2014 the first reported \"floaty rock\" in US soil that's being sent to the University of South California (USC) for additional testing. You can see that in action by expanding the below tweet. Meissner effect or bust: Day 8.5We made the rocks pic.twitter.com/ygVOATBaHDAugust 4, 2023 All in all, that's not a bad result for a \"couple days\" work: McCalip managed to be the first in US soil to actually demonstrate what seems to be a Meissner-effect levitation on the LK-99 flake he managed to synthesize.

And as we'll detail below, you might also find difficulty sourcing some of the materials needed.", "If one person has stood among the eddies of the LK-99 superconductor drama as it happens in the US, that person is Andrew McCalip. The R&D engineer with California-based Varda Space Industries, McCalip has been at the forefront of public, independent replication efforts around the serendipitous superconductor, open-sourcing his work through Twitter and live-streaming the cooking process over Twitch - a relatively rare generosity. From his process, we can glean more information about the elusive LK-99 compound, its synthethization process, how difficult that process is in the face of restrictions around some of the required materials, and the somewhat \"spotty\" manufacturing process described in the original Korean paper. You can see his efforts in the two albums of images below.", "The main issue in replication stems from the cloudy process described in the original Korean paper \u2014 the documentation for making the material is incredibly vague. This fact is made evident by the buzz surrounding replication attempts, but it's also led to a veritable graveyard of failed samples in McCalip's possession. \n\nMaterials scientists will tell you that for baking processes, essential data include the temperature (at around 725 \u00ba C in a vacuum), how long it takes to bake, and what temperatures (the paper gives a baking time-band of 5-24 hours, which as you can imagine, introduces a lot of error), and the rate of quenching (that is, how fast should the samples' temperature be forced to drop). \n\nThe rate of quenching isn't even mentioned in the original Korean paper, leading McCalip (and other replicators, we imagine) to perform a sort of Russian roulette that's led to several differing, alien-looking samples of the LK-99 compound \u2014 and a number of broken ampules containing proto-attempts at synthesizing the compound. McCalip estimates that 2/3 of baked vials are rejects due to the lack of detailed information on the manufacturing process, a \"yield-wall\" that other researchers too will have to contend with.", "As we've dived into before, LK-99 is a compound that results from reacting lead sulfate with a copper-phosphorous compound. The ingredients are usually easy to commission \u2014 red phosphorus and copper to synthesize copper phosphide, and lead sulfate and lead oxide, which together form a mineral called lanarkite. \n\nAs it's currently understood, the addition of copper into the lanarkite baking process forces some of the lead atoms to be replaced by copper atoms in an unpredictable and currently incontrollable ratio. It seems that it's these copper atoms displacing lead that leads to LK-99's superconductive properties (due to the emergence of what are known as Fermi bands), manifested in the hallmark emergent magnetism (courtesy of the Meissner effect) and zero resistance to electrical conductivity (most of the drama surrounding LK-99 today surrounds its claimed room-temperature superconductivity not having yet been replicated, however).", "On perhaps a less optimistic note, however, it seems the frenzy around LK-99 - and its almost \"kitchen-counter\" manufacturing requirements have dried up an unsuspecting worldwide supply chain.", "As McCalip put it, it was relatively tough to secure one of the particular ingredients, red phosphorous, as it's a controlled substance that can also be used to synthesize morphine derivatives. But the combined brain power of Twitter devised that he could secure a shipment of copper phosphide (fewer synthetization steps) through a local California lab. According to him, he also managed to secure a supply from Poland before the supply dried up, a perhaps meaningful bit for the worldwide efforts to replicate and better understand LK-99.", "The relatively cheap and abundant base minerals mean it's unlikely they'll be long-term bottlenecks toward LK-99 manufacturing at scale (if that's the actual road we're on). But the worldwide supply chain isn't ready for sudden \"black swan\"-imposed demand jumps, which means that the current street price for Copper Phosphate has climbed precipitously towards the $20,000-per-kilogram ratio. There's a scenario where the mineral supply bottleneck could hinder research efforts; unfortunately, the world of minerals and chemistry is vulnerable to supply hoarders that aim to turn a quick profit, although it's a much more well-regulated arena than, say, GPU and game console purchases. Fortunately.", "In the end, McCalip and Varda's replication attempts resulted in a small, unsuspecting flake of LK-99 showcasing the same Meissner-effect-induced magnetic levitation \u2014 the first reported \"floaty rock\" in US soil that's being sent to the University of South California (USC) for additional testing.

Wikipedia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LK-99", "text": "  LK-99 (from the Lee-Kim 1999 research),[2] is a potential room-temperature superconductor with a gray-black appearance.[3]:\u200a8\u200a It is said to have a hexagonal structure that is slightly modified from lead\u2012apatite by adding small amounts of copper. A team from Korea University led by Sukbae Lee (\uc774\uc11d\ubc30) and Ji-Hoon Kim (\uae40\uc9c0\ud6c8) began studying this material in 1999.[3]:\u200a1\u200a According to their claims, LK-99 acts as a superconductor at temperatures below 400\u00a0K (127\u00a0\u00b0C; 260\u00a0\u00b0F) and at ambient pressure.[2][4][3]:\u200a1 As of 5 August 2023, the scientific community has not validated the superconductivity of LK-99 at any temperature through peer-reviewed processes or independent replication by other research groups.[5] One preprint by a team from Southeast University, China has reported an observation of zero resistance at 110 K (-163 \u2103, -261 \u2109).[6] However the absence of a well-defined phase transition, absence of the Meissner effect (a defining characteristic of superconductors), and the unique conditions under which these results were obtained raised doubts about the validity of the claim. Multiple other independent research teams are currently attempting to replicate the work of the South Korean team. Results are expected in August 2023, as the process of producing the material is said to be straightforward.[7] The initial studies announcing the discovery of LK-99 were uploaded to the open-access repository of electronic preprints, arXiv.  Lee later claimed the uploaded preprint papers were incomplete,[8] and coauthor Hyun-Tak Kim (\uae40\ud604\ud0c1) stated that one of the papers contained defects.[9] The chemical composition of LK-99 is approximately Pb9Cu(PO4)6O, in which\u2014 compared to pure lead-apatite (Pb10(PO4)6O)[10]:\u200a5\u200a\u2014 approximately one quarter of Pb(II) ions in position 2 of the apatite structure are replaced by Cu(II) ions.[3]:\u200a9 The structure is similar to that of apatite, space group P63/m (No. 176). Lee et al. provide a method for chemical synthesis of LK-99[10]:\u200a2\u200a in three steos.  First they produce lanarkite from a 1:1 molar mixing of lead(II) oxide (PbO) and lead(II) sulfate (Pb(SO4)) powders, and heating at 725\u00a0\u00b0C (1,000\u00a0K; 1,340\u00a0\u00b0F) for 24 hours: Then, copper(I) phosphide (Cu3P) is produced by mixing copper (Cu) and phosphorus (P) powders in a 3:1 molar ratio in a sealed tube under a vacuum and heated to 550\u00a0\u00b0C (820\u00a0K; 1,000\u00a0\u00b0F) for 48 hours:[10]:\u200a3 Then, lanarkite and copper phosphide crystals are ground into a powder, placed in a sealed tube under a vacuum, and heated to 925\u00a0\u00b0C (1,200\u00a0K; 1,700\u00a0\u00b0F) for between 5\u201220 hours:[10]:\u200a3 The above reaction from the intial paper is not balanced, however. A paper by Kapil Kumar et al. reported the presence of Cu2S as well.[11] A balanced reaction might be: Some LK-99 samples have been reported to show strong diamagnetic properties, including partial levitation over a magnet,[10] which is correlated with superconductivity. While the initial articles claim the material is a room-temperature superconductor,[10]:\u200a1\u200a they do not claim to have seen definitive features of superconductivity, zero resistance and the Meissner effect. Because many materials can spuriously seem like potential candidates for high-temperature superconductivity,[12] researchers testing for superconductivity generally demonstrate not only a zero-resistance mode and a clear Meissner effect, but also demonstrate other expected properties such as flux pinning, AC magnetic susceptibility, the Josephson effect, a temperature-dependent critical field and current, or a sudden jump in specific heat around the critical temperature.[13] As of August 1, none of these have been observed by the original experiment or attempted replications.[14] Partial replacement of Pb2+ ions (measuring 133 picometres) with Cu2+ ions (measuring 87 picometres) is said to cause a 0.48% reduction in volume, creating internal stress inside the material.[3]:\u200a8\u200a The internal stress is claimed to cause a heterojunction quantum well between the Pb(1) and oxygen within the phosphate ([PO4]3\u2212) generating a superconducting quantum well (SQW).[3]:\u200a10 Lee et al. claim to show LK-99 exhibits a response to a magnetic field (potentially due to the Meissner effect) when chemical vapor deposition is used to apply LK-99 to a non-magnetic copper sample.[3]:\u200a4\u200a Pure lead-apatite is an insulator, but Lee et al. claim copper-doped lead-apatite forming LK-99 is a superconductor, or at higher temperatures, a metal.[10]:\u200a5\u200a They do not claim to have observed any change in behavior across a transition temperature. The paper's mechanisms were based on a 2021 paper[15] by Hyun-Tak Kim describing a novel \"BR-BCS\" theory of superconductivity combining a classical theory of metal-insulator transitions[16] with the standard Bardeen\u2013Cooper\u2013Schrieffer theory of superconductivity. They also use ideas from the theory of hole superconductivity[17] by J.E.Hirsch, another controversial work. On 31 July 2023, Sin\u00e9ad Griffin of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory analyzed LK-99 with density functional theory (DFT) with the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package, showing that its structure would have correlated isolated flat bands, one of the signatures of high-transition-temperature superconductors.[18] On 1 August 2023, two additional independent groups published analyses of LK-99 with density functional theory. Si and Held[19] found similar flat bands and conjectured that LK-99 is a Mott or charge transfer insulator, that electron or hole doping is needed to make it (super)conducting. The name LK-99 is from the initials of discoverers Sukbae Lee and Ji-Hoon Kim, and the year of discovery (1999).[2] The pair had originally been working with Tong-Shik Choi (\ucd5c\ub3d9\uc2dd) at Korea University in the 1990s.[20] In 2008, researchers from Korea University founded the Quantum Energy Research Centre (\ud000\ud140 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0\uc5f0\uad6c\uc18c; also known as Q-Centre).[8] Lee would later become CEO of Q-Centre, and Kim would become director of research and development (R&D) at Q-Centre. Lee has stated that in 2020, an initial paper was submitted to Nature, but was rejected.[20] Similarly-presented research on room-temperature superconductors (but a totally different chemical system) by Ranga P. Dias had been published in Nature earlier that year, and received with skepticism\u2014Dias's paper would subsequently be retracted in 2022 after its data was questioned as having been falsified.[21] In 2020, Lee and Ji-Hoon Kim filed a patent application.[22]  A second patent application (additionally listing Young-Wan Kwon), was filed in 2021, which was published on 3 March 2023.[23] A WIPO patent was also published on 2 March 2023.[24] On 4 April 2023, a Korean trademark application for \"LK-99\" was filed by the Q-Centre.[25] In February 2023, the Q-Centre published a video on YouTube claiming to show the magnetic properties of a thin layer of LK-99 thermally deposited on a copper plate.[26] A series of academic publications summarizing initial findings came out in 2023, with a total of seven authors across four publications. On 31 March 2023, a Korean-language paper, \"Consideration for the development of room-temperature ambient-pressure superconductor (LK-99)\", was submitted to the Korean Journal of Crystal Growth and Crystal Technology.[4] It was accepted on 18 April, but was not widely read until three months later. On 22 July 2023, two preprints appeared on arXiv. The first was submitted by Young-Wan Kwon, and listed Kwon, former Q-Centre CTO, as third author.[3] The second preprint was submitted by Hyun-Tak Kim, and listed Kim, former principal researcher at the Electronics & Telecommunications Research Institute and professor at the College of William & Mary, as third author, as well as three new authors.[10][27] On 23 July, the findings were also submitted by Lee to APL Materials for peer review.[20][8] On 28 July 2023, Kwon presented the findings at a symposium held at Korea University.[28][29][30] That same day, Yonhap News Agency published an article quoting an official from Korea University as saying that Kwon was no longer in contact with the University.[8] The article also quoted Lee saying that Kwon had left the Q-Centre Research Institute four months previously;[8] that the academic papers on LK-99 were not finished and contained many defects; and that the papers had been uploaded to arXiv without the other authors' permission.[8][27] On 31 July 2023, a group led by Kapil Kumar published a preprint on arXiv documenting their replication attempts, which confirmed the structure using X-ray crystallography (XRD) but failed to find diamagnetism or levitation.[11] On 1 August 2023, a Q-Centre representative told SBS News that the original samples referenced in the paper would be released to the world for verification soon.[31] On 3 August 2023, the Korean LK-99 Verification Committee requested a high-quality sample from the original research team. However, the team responded that they would only provide the sample once the review process of their paper, potentially submitted to APL Materials, is completed. This process is expected to take several weeks or months.[32] On the same day, Hyun-Tak Kim, one of the authors of the 6 author July 22 arXiv-LK-99 paper, provided the New York Times with a new video presumably showing a sample displaying strong signs of diamagnetism.[2] The video appears to show a sample different to the one in the original preprint, suggesting the group's ability to reproduce their samples. On 4 August 2023, Hyun-Tak Kim informed SBS News that high-quality LK-99 samples may exhibit diamagnetism 5,450 times greater than graphite, while low-quality samples may demonstrate an effect up to 23 times stronger. Moreover, he claimed that the diamagnetism of LK-99 is inexplicable unless the substance is a superconductor [33], a hypothesis also proposed in a theoretical paper on LK-99 by TU Wien and Northwest University. Author credit[a 1] and affiliation matrix: Materials scientists and superconductor researchers responded with skepticism.[9][34] The highest-temperature superconductors known at the time of publication had a critical temperature of 250\u00a0K (\u221223\u00a0\u00b0C; \u221210\u00a0\u00b0F) at pressures of over 170 gigapascals (1,680,000\u00a0atm; 24,700,000\u00a0psi). The highest-temperature superconductors at atmospheric pressure (1 atm) had a critical temperature of at most 150\u00a0K (\u2212123\u00a0\u00b0C; \u2212190\u00a0\u00b0F). On 2 August 2023, the The Korean Society of Superconductivity and Cryogenics established a verification committee as a response to the controversy and unverified claims of LK-99, in order to arrive at conclusions over these claims. The verification committee is headed by Kim Chang-Young of Seoul National University and consists of members of the university, Sungkyunkwan University and Pohang University of Science and Technology. Upon formation, the verification committee did not agree that the two 22 July arXiv papers by Lee et al. or the publicly available videos at the time supported the claim of LK-99 being a superconductor.[27][35] As of 4\u00a0August\u00a02023[update], the measured properties do not prove that LK-99 is a superconductor as the published material does not fully explain how the LK-99's magnetisation can change, demonstrate its specific heat capacity, or demonstrate it crossing its transition temperature.[9] An alternative explanation for LK-99's stated partial magnetic levitation could be solely from non-superconductive diamagnetism.[27][36] The claims of a room-temperature superconductor in the 22 July papers by Lee et al. went viral on social media platforms the following week,[7] including Twitter and Reddit.[37] The viral nature of the claim resulted in posts from users using pseudonyms from Russia and China claiming to have replicated LK-99 on both Twitter and Zhihu.[38] Other claims came from viral videos that described themselves as having replicated samples of LK-99 levitating.[34] Despite interest from commentators, scientists interviewed by the press remained skeptical.[39][40] Reasons given for skepticism included issues with the Lee et al. July 22 preprint papers, the lack of purity in the sample reported by Lee et al. and the failure of previous claims of room temperature superconductivity to show legitimacy.[27] The Korean Society of Superconductivity and Cryogenics has expressed concern on the social and economic impacts of the LK-99 research, as it has not been verified nor peer-reviewed.[41] A video from Huazhong University of Science and Technology uploaded on 1 August 2023 by a postdoctoral researcher on the team of Chang Haixin,[27] apparently showed a micrometre-sized sample of LK-99 levitating that went viral on Chinese social media. Gathering millions of views, it became the second most viewed video on Bilibili the next day.[42] On 3 August, it became the most viewed video on Bilibili with 9 million views.[27] A researcher from the Chinese Academy of Sciences refused to comment on the video for the press, dismissing the claim as \"ridiculous\".[42] Public excitement grew after the video made its way to western social media, with a prediction market briefly putting the chance of successful replication at 60%.[43] As the topic of LK-99 trended on Twitter for days at the start of August, users began to create memes about \"floating rocks\" and suggested backing stocks in superconductors.[44] It was concurrently reported in the press that the study had caused a surge in Korean and Chinese technology stocks,[45][46][47] despite warnings from the Korean stock exchange against speculative bets in light of the excitement around LK-99.[41] As of 5\u00a0August\u00a02023[update], the experiment has not been successfully replicated, despite the initial experiments being completed in 2020. No replication attempts have yet been peer-reviewed. After the July 2023 publications release, independent groups reported that they had begun attempting to reproduce the synthesis, with initial results expected within weeks.[7] However while positive results can come quickly, negative results are slow, as \"falsification needs to verify all possibilities, and it will take a lot of time.\"[48] The first attempts that published results did not observe levitation or diamagnetism, and their samples had high resistivity. None have published tests of flux pinning or specific heat capacity. Early replication efforts gained global visibility, with the aid of online replication trackers that cataloged new announcements and status updates.[38]  Some researchers released brief teaser images or videos before publishing any results, which received great public attention. On 1 August 2023, a team at Huazhong University of Science and Technology in China reported producing tiny flakes that showed diamagnetic levitation, on their second attempt.[14] On 2 August 2023, a team around Sun Yue at Southeast University, claimed to have measured zero resistance in a flake of LK-99 up to a temperature of 110\u00a0K (\u2212163\u00a0\u00b0C; \u2212262\u00a0\u00b0F).[49] Doubts were expressed by experts in the field. Criticism included the results had what looked like a large measurement artifact, did not show the expected dropoff to zero resistance, were quite noisy and instruments used were unable to measure resistance below 10 \u00b5\u03a9, which is high for measurements of superconductors.[34][50] Results Key:\n\u00a0\u00a0Success\n\u00a0\u00a0Partial Success\n\u00a0\u00a0Partial Failure\n\u00a0\u00a0Failure Video posted to bilibili.[52][53] Press coverage:[14][27][42][38] Press coverage:[44][55] Critical responses:[34][50] Press coverage:[49][56] Press coverage:[27][44][38][55] Team headed by Andrew McCalip.

The verification committee is headed by Kim Chang-Young of Seoul National University and consists of members of the university, Sungkyunkwan University and Pohang University of Science and Technology. Upon formation, the verification committee did not agree that the two 22 July arXiv papers by Lee et al. or the publicly available videos at the time supported the claim of LK-99 being a superconductor.[27][35]", "As of 4\u00a0August\u00a02023[update], the measured properties do not prove that LK-99 is a superconductor as the published material does not fully explain how the LK-99's magnetisation can change, demonstrate its specific heat capacity, or demonstrate it crossing its transition temperature.[9] An alternative explanation for LK-99's stated partial magnetic levitation could be solely from non-superconductive diamagnetism.[27][36]", "The claims of a room-temperature superconductor in the 22 July papers by Lee et al. went viral on social media platforms the following week,[7] including Twitter and Reddit.[37] The viral nature of the claim resulted in posts from users using pseudonyms from Russia and China claiming to have replicated LK-99 on both Twitter and Zhihu.[38] Other claims came from viral videos that described themselves as having replicated samples of LK-99 levitating.[34] Despite interest from commentators, scientists interviewed by the press remained skeptical.[39][40] Reasons given for skepticism included issues with the Lee et al. July 22 preprint papers, the lack of purity in the sample reported by Lee et al. and the failure of previous claims of room temperature superconductivity to show legitimacy.[27] The Korean Society of Superconductivity and Cryogenics has expressed concern on the social and economic impacts of the LK-99 research, as it has not been verified nor peer-reviewed.[41]", "A video from Huazhong University of Science and Technology uploaded on 1 August 2023 by a postdoctoral researcher on the team of Chang Haixin,[27] apparently showed a micrometre-sized sample of LK-99 levitating that went viral on Chinese social media. Gathering millions of views, it became the second most viewed video on Bilibili the next day.[42] On 3 August, it became the most viewed video on Bilibili with 9 million views.[27] A researcher from the Chinese Academy of Sciences refused to comment on the video for the press, dismissing the claim as \"ridiculous\".[42] Public excitement grew after the video made its way to western social media, with a prediction market briefly putting the chance of successful replication at 60%.[43] As the topic of LK-99 trended on Twitter for days at the start of August, users began to create memes about \"floating rocks\" and suggested backing stocks in superconductors.[44] It was concurrently reported in the press that the study had caused a surge in Korean and Chinese technology stocks,[45][46][47] despite warnings from the Korean stock exchange against speculative bets in light of the excitement around LK-99.[41]", "As of 5\u00a0August\u00a02023[update], the experiment has not been successfully replicated, despite the initial experiments being completed in 2020. No replication attempts have yet been peer-reviewed. After the July 2023 publications release, independent groups reported that they had begun attempting to reproduce the synthesis, with initial results expected within weeks.[7] However while positive results can come quickly, negative results are slow, as \"falsification needs to verify all possibilities, and it will take a lot of time.\"[48]", "The first attempts that published results did not observe levitation or diamagnetism, and their samples had high resistivity. None have published tests of flux pinning or specific heat capacity.", "Early replication efforts gained global visibility, with the aid of online replication trackers that cataloged new announcements and status updates.[38]  Some researchers released brief teaser images or videos before publishing any results, which received great public attention. On 1 August 2023, a team at Huazhong University of Science and Technology in China reported producing tiny flakes that showed diamagnetic levitation, on their second attempt.[14]", "On 2 August 2023, a team around Sun Yue at Southeast University, claimed to have measured zero resistance in a flake of LK-99 up to a temperature of 110\u00a0K (\u2212163\u00a0\u00b0C; \u2212262\u00a0\u00b0F).[49] Doubts were expressed by experts in the field. Criticism included the results had what looked like a large measurement artifact, did not show the expected dropoff to zero resistance, were quite noisy and instruments used were unable to measure resistance below 10 \u00b5\u03a9, which is high for measurements of superconductors.[34][50]", "Results Key:\n\u00a0\u00a0Success\n\u00a0\u00a0Partial Success\n\u00a0\u00a0Partial Failure\n\u00a0\u00a0Failure", "Video posted to bilibili.[52][53]", "Press coverage:[14][27][42][38]", "Press coverage:[44][55]", "Critical responses:[34][50]", "Press coverage:[49][56]", "Press coverage:[27][44][38][55]", "Team headed by Andrew McCalip.

To revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories. Gregory Barber All that Andrew McCalip wanted for his 34th birthday was a shipment of red phosphorus. It was a tough request\u2014the substance happens to be an ingredient for cooking meth and is controlled by the US Drug Enforcement Agency\u2014but also an essential one, if McCalip was going to realize his dream of making a room-temperature superconductor, a holy grail of condensed matter physics, in his startup\u2019s lab over the next week. It required four ingredients, and so far he had access to three. His followers on X (that is, Twitter, post-rebrand), offered ideas: He could melt down the heads of a pile of matchsticks, or try to buy it in pure form off Etsy, where the DEA might not be looking. Others offered connections to Eastern European suppliers. They were deeply invested in his effort. Like McCalip, many had learned about a possible superconductor called LK-99 earlier that week through a post on Hacker News, which linked to an Arxiv preprint in which a trio of South Korean researchers had claimed a discovery that, in their words, \u201copens a new era for humankind.\u201d Now McCalip was among those racing to replicate it. Superconductivity\u2014a set of properties in which electrical resistance drops to zero\u2014typically appears only under frigid or high pressure conditions. But the researchers claimed LK-99 exhibited these qualities at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. Among the evidence: an apparent drop in resistance to zero at 400 Kelvin (127 degrees Celsius) and a video of the material levitating above a magnet. The authors, led by Ji-Hoon Kim and Young-Wan Kwon, proposed that this was the result of the Meissner effect, the expulsion of a magnetic field as a material crosses the threshold of superconductivity. If that were true, it could indeed lead to a new era: resistanceless power lines, practical levitating trains, and powerful quantum devices. On X and Reddit, large language models went by the wayside. The new star was condensed matter physics. Online betting markets were spun up (the odds: not particularly good). Anons with a strangely sophisticated knowledge of electronic band structure went to war with techno-optimistic influencers cheering on an apparent resurgence of technological progress. Their mantra was seductive, and maybe a little reductive: a return to a time of leapfrogging discoveries\u2014the lightbulb, the Manhattan Project, the internet\u2014where the impact of scientific discovery is tangible within the span of a human\u2019s earthly presence. \u201cWe\u2019re back,\u201d as one X user put it. Experts are doubtful. Multiple versions of the LK-99 paper have appeared online with inconsistent data\u2014reportedly the result of warring between the authors about the precise nature of the claim. The researchers aren\u2019t well known in the field, and their analysis lacks basic tests typically used to confirm superconductivity. Spurious claims are also so common in the field that physicists joke about USOs\u2014\u201cunidentified superconducting objects\u201d\u2014a play on UFOs. (Most recent sighting: a room-temperature, high-pressure material from a University of Rochester lab that has been dogged by accusations of plagiarism and rigged data.) There are more likely explanations for the levitation, explains Richard Greene, a condensed matter physicist at the University of Maryland, including magnetic properties in the compound in its normal, non-superconducting state. The betting markets probably had it right: Odds are the new era is not yet upon us. But the claim is still worth checking out, Greene adds. In his long career studying superconductive materials, he\u2019s seen advances come from outsiders with puzzling papers that explored unfamiliar types of compounds. That includes, in the 1980s, a class of materials that exhibited superconductivity above the boiling point of liquid nitrogen (\u2013196 degrees C), making way for all sorts of applications, from magnetic resonance imagery to tokamaks for nuclear fusion. Plus, because physicists understand the mechanics of only certain forms of superconductivity, a seemingly strange or inconsistent result can\u2019t immediately be discounted. Perhaps it\u2019s just something nobody has seen before. Gregory Barber Adrienne So Julian Chokkattu Matt Simon Greene was at a physics retreat in Aspen, Colorado, when news of LK-99 broke and the crowd of theoreticians there leapt into action. \u201cEveryone is entering this skeptical but interested,\u201d says Cyrus Dreyer, a fellow attendee who studies computational materials physics at Stony Brook University in New York. He is spending his week in the mountains trying to compute the electronic structure of the proposed material\u2014something that could help his colleagues understand whether it conforms to existing theories of superconductivity. What\u2019s perhaps most intriguing, he adds, is that LK-99 is relatively simple to make. He and Greene estimate dozens of teams are working on it. That includes non-experts with access to the right equipment\u2014like McCalip, who decided to give it a try the day after reading the LK-99 preprint. Why? \u201cBecause it\u2019s the holy grail,\u201d he explains. \u201cThis is what dreams are made of.\u201d While the professional physicists worked to replicate the experiment in private, McCalip decided that he and his colleagues would do their work in public. He declared his intention on X: \u201cMeissner effect or bust.\u201d The goal: a video of levitation. He hoped to be among the first to see evidence of room-temperature superconductivity\u2014and all his followers would see it along with him. \u201cIt felt like the whole internet was cheering us on,\u201d he says. The pressure ramped up for his DIY team when he set up a Twitch livestream and, within minutes, discovered he was in the top 10, with 16,000 viewers tuning in as they set up their furnace. \u201cThere was this moment of panic,\u201d he says. He thought of the little-known South Korean scientists who had made an extraordinary claim that the whole world was now putting to the test. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine what it\u2019s like to be in their shoes,\u201d he adds. At least if his plan didn\u2019t work out, he could claim it was for the friends and fun along the way. Gregory Barber Adrienne So Julian Chokkattu Matt Simon Making LK-99 is not quite garage science, but it is a relatively simple alchemy. The El Segundo, California, lab of Varda Space Industries, the satellite startup where McCalip is an engineer, happens to contain the appropriate furnaces, vacuum systems, and environmental chambers. All that McCalip would require was four ingredients: red phosphorus and copper to synthesize copper phosphide, and lead sulfate and lead oxide to make a mineral called lanarkite. Those two materials would then be pulverized, mixed, blasted with heat, and cooled, producing something that\u2019s close to another familiar compound\u2014lead apatite\u2014but in which some lead atoms have been swapped out for copper. He secured the copper phosphide from a local lab, skipping the need for raw red phosphorus, and the game was on. (A Polish supplier he contacted came through too, and the shipment is due to arrive soon; McCalip says he cleared them out before the hype wiped out the global supply.) The first steps involved waiting. Twenty-four hours for the lanarkite, which was still in the oven at 725 degrees Celsius when McCalip and I spoke. The outside lab would take a few days to get him the copper phosphide. The Varda engineers were doing their normal work on space-based manufacturing during the day and mostly checking in at night. Meanwhile, the livestream viewers seemed a little bored, flooding the comments with nationalist politics and theories about the interpersonal drama between the LK-99 authors. McCalip wasn\u2019t getting much sleep between his two jobs, but he was feeling confident they could make the material\u2014or at least some approximation of it. The authors of the LK-99 paper had not made it easy to follow their recipe, leaving out crucial instructions for things like testing the purity of the precursors and setting the cooling rates of the furnaces. McCalip had found a patent filing that supplied a few more details, but he still had a long list of questions that he\u2019d like to get in front of the South Korean researchers. He was asking for leads through Twitter and Varda\u2019s investors. (The two lead researchers, Kim and Kwon, didn\u2019t respond to WIRED\u2019s interview request either.) Those details are crucial, because whatever is going on inside LK-99, it\u2019s likely caused by a very particular arrangement of atoms. The researchers theorized that superconductivity is the result of replacing certain lead atoms with copper, which shrinks the crystal lattice and causes an internal tension. At a high level, \u201cthat\u2019s certainly a plausible thing,\u201d Greene says. Much of the field\u2019s recent work has involved exerting extremely high pressure on substances that contain hydrogen atoms\u2014based on the theory that pure hydrogen compressed into a solid form would itself be a superconductor. Such extreme pressures are impractical for most applications, so researchers are interested in ways of simulating the effect with internal pressure that comes from forces within the crystal itself. It\u2019s an interesting strategy, he says\u2014though, of course, it\u2019s not at all clear whether that\u2019s happening here. Gregory Barber Adrienne So Julian Chokkattu Matt Simon Over the weekend, with the ingredients still cooking, McCalip was riding an \u201cemotional rollercoaster,\u201d he told me. Many of his followers were still cheering him on, and he had gotten some great fan mail (\u201cblue meth\u201d rock candy from the woman who supplied the props for Breaking Bad), but the physicists\u2019 skepticism had started to dim the internet\u2019s excitement. On X, people were throwing around the word \u201cdiamagnetism\u201d a lot, arguing that the substance appeared to float not because it had crossed a superconductivity threshold, but because it was already a magnet to start off with. A discussion on the Reddit forum r/singularity put it succinctly: Why was LK-99 barely mentioned on r/science and r/engineering? Because LK-99 is hype, not science. Then came a report: a respected lab in India said it had made LK\u201399. Superconductivity? Nope. Other results trickled in. It seemed everyone was measuring something different, perhaps because they were each making something different. Next, a preprint from a physicist, Sin\u00e9ad Griffin, at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab seemed to offer a theoretical explanation for what the South Korean scientists might have seen. That was followed by caution from computational physicists like Dreyer from Stony Brook that it wasn\u2019t really evidence one way or the other. The betting markets swooned and surged. McCalip preferred not to dwell, and instead chose to focus on what he had set out to do: making the thing. They were making more batches of lanarkite, and the copper phosphide was arriving soon. He hoped to try for the Meissner effect in his lab by the end of the week, using a massive neodymium magnet that his coworker happened to have sitting in his garage. After that they\u2019d bring the sample to a materials science lab at the University of Southern California for more elaborate tests. Superconductor or not, LK-99 was still a strange and interesting substance, he thought. He had doubts. \u201cI don\u2019t think the rocks will float,\u201d McCalip told me. But he knew his experiment wouldn\u2019t be the end of the road. Such was the nature of science. There would be many more replications to follow his own. \ud83d\udce9 Don\u2019t miss our biggest stories, delivered to your inbox every day \ud83c\udfa7 Our new podcast wants you to Have a Nice Future The AI-powered, totally autonomous future of war is here I looked into Sam Altman\u2019s orb and all I got was this lousy crypto These tools make it easy to write and work on the go Heat is shaking the very foundation of the ocean food web Twitter scammers stole $1,000 from my friend\u2014so I hunted them down \ud83c\udf32 Our Gear team has branched out with a new guide to the best sleeping pads and fresh picks for the best coolers and binoculars Will Knight Will Knight Will Knight Morgan Meaker David Nield Aarian Marshall Will Knight Will Bedingfield More From WIRED Contact \u00a9 2023 Cond\u00e9 Nast.

A superconducting magnet is cooled by liquid nitrogen, producing a strong magnetic field that causes the magnet to levitate.Credit: Patrick Gaillardin/LookAt Sciences/SPL A Korean team\u2019s claim to have discovered a superconductor that works at room temperature and ambient pressure has become a viral sensation \u2014 and prompted a slew of replication efforts by scientists and amateurs alike. But initial efforts to experimentally and theoretically reproduce the buzzworthy result have come up short, and researchers remain deeply sceptical. The research team, led by Sukbae Lee and Ji-Hoon Kim at the start-up firm Quantum Energy Research Centre in Seoul said in preprints published on 25 July1,2 that a compound of copper, lead, phosphorus and oxygen, dubbed LK-99, is a superconductor at ambient pressure and temperatures above 127 \u00b0C (400 Kelvin). The team claims that samples show two key signs of superconductivity: zero electrical resistance and the Meissner effect, in which the material expels magnetic fields, leading samples to levitate above a magnet. Previous efforts have achieved superconductivity only in certain materials under incredibly low temperatures or extremely high pressures. No material has ever been confirmed to be a superconductor under ambient conditions. LK-99\u2019s purported superconductivity drew immediate scrutiny from scientists. \u201cMy first impression was \u2018no.\u2019\u201d says Inna Vishik, a condensed matter experimentalist at the University of California, Davis. \u201cThese \u2018Unidentified Superconducting Objects\u2019, as they\u2019re sometimes called, reliably show up on the arXiv. There\u2019s a new one every year or so.\u201d Advances in superconductivity are often touted for their potential practical impact on technologies such as computer chips and maglev trains, but Vishik points out that such excitement might be misplaced. Historically, progress in superconductivity has had tremendous benefits for basic science, but little in the way of everyday applications. There\u2019s no guarantee a material that is a room-temperature superconductor would be of practical use, Vishik says. The first attempts to replicate LK-99, reported in the past days, have not improved the material\u2019s prospects. None of the studies provide direct evidence for any superconductivity in the material. (The Korean team did not respond to Nature\u2019s request for comment.) Two separate experimental efforts by teams at the National Physical Laboratory of India in New Delhi3 and Beihang University in Beijing4, reported synthesizing LK-99, but did not observe signs of superconductivity. A third experiment by researchers at Southeast University in Nanjing5 found no Meissner effect, but measured near zero resistance in LK-99 at -163 \u00b0C (110 K) \u2014 which is far below room temperature, but high for superconductors. Theorists have also entered the fray. Several theoretical studies6,7,8,9 used a computational technique called density functional theory (DFT) to calculate LK-99\u2019s electronic structure. The DFT calculations suggest LK-99 might have interesting electronic features that, in other materials, have been associated with behavior such as ferromagnetism and superconductivity. But none of the studies found evidence that LK-99 is a superconductor at ambient conditions. Replicators first attempted to synthesize LK-99, following the process described by the Korean team, which involved mixing powdered components and two stages of heating up to 925 \u00b0C. (The high temperatures and use of lead have prompted concerns about amateur replication attempts, which researchers say are dangerous.) To confirm that material\u2019s structure and identity, replicators used X-ray diffraction, an atomic imaging technique. The Beihang team concluded that their sample\u2019s structure was \u201chighly consistent\u201d with that of LK-99. A co-author on the National Physical Laboratory team, physicist Veerpal Singh Awana, acknowledged small differences between their sample and that of the Korean team. \u201cOur LK-99 is very similar to that as the reported superconducting LK-99,\u201d he says. But Robert Palgrave, a chemist at University College London, says that both teams\u2019 materials differ from the original. Both X-ray diffraction patterns are significantly different from the Korean team\u2019s patterns and from each other, says Palgrave. (Members of the Beihang team did not respond to Nature\u2019s request for comment.) The Southeastern University team\u2019s experiment produced X-ray diffraction data that is more consistent with the Korean team\u2019s sample, according to Palgrave. But several researchers have questioned their claim of achieving zero resistance at -163 \u00b0C. Evan Zalys-Geller, a condensed matter physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, says that the resistance measurement wasn\u2019t sensitive enough to distinguish between a zero resistance superconductor or a low-resistance metal like copper. (Members of the Southeastern University team did not respond to a request for comment.) Uncertainty about the structure of LK-99 limits the conclusions that researchers can draw from theoretical studies, which assume a given structure for the material to make calculations. On 31 July, a theoretical analysis posted on Twitter prompted excitement among online enthusiasts. Sin\u00e9ad Griffin, who studies quantum materials at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California, shared her theory paper, accompanied by a gif of former US president Barack Obama performing a \u2018mic drop\u2019. The optimism was prompted by Griffin\u2019s use of DFT to find that LK-99 has \u2018flat bands\u2019, a feature that indicates electrons in the material are strongly correlated with each other. \u201cFlat band systems tend to show interesting physics,\u201d Vishik says. \u201cSo when a material is predicted to have a flat band, people get kind of excited.\u201d Griffin later rebuffed the optimism, tweeting: \u201cMy paper did *not* prove nor give evidence of superconductivity.\u201d Other theory papers also suggested the presence of flat bands, but all of them suffer from the same assumption about the structure, says Leslie Schoop, a solid state chemist at Princeton University in New Jersey. \u201cIn a nutshell, I don\u2019t believe any of the DFT before I know the correct crystal structure,\u201d she says. Griffin agrees that knowing the structure is essential. But she says that the structure found by the Korean team is similar to that of other lead phosphate minerals. \u201cSo it\u2019s not too bizarre to think it possible.\u201d Even if future experiments confirm flat bands, the feature does not mean the material would display room-temperature superconductivity, Schoop says. The association between flat bands and superconductivity comes from other materials, such as \u2018twisted\u2019 layers of graphene \u2014 slightly offset sheets of atomically thin carbon \u2014 which displayed superconductivity at -271 \u00b0C (1.7 K) and featured flat bands. But this does not provide evidence for superconductivity above 127 \u00b0C (400 K) in the lead-based LK-99, Schoop says. The limited success of the replication attempts has not quelled speculation online. Unverified videos of samples, supposedly levitating because of superconductivity, have circulated as viral evidence, despite the fact that many materials \u2014 including graphene, frogs and pliers \u2014 can exhibit similar magnetic behaviour. Previous room-temperature superconductivity claims, including one made in March by the controversial physicist Ranga Dias, have made headlines. But the viral attention associated with LK-99 has surpassed many of its predecessors. Frustrated by the atmosphere of hype, some scientists have taken to mimicking the levitation videos with everyday materials suspended by string and other props. \u201cI opened Twitter up one day and noticed a bunch of sketchy videos with little floating pebbles,\u201d says Eric Aspling, a physicist at Binghamton University in New York. In response, he uploaded a video featuring a \u201csample of LK-99 shaped as a fork\u201d suspended by tape. \u201cI thought, \u2018How can anybody be convinced by this?\u2019,\u201d he says. doi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-023-02481-0 Lee, S. et al.

But initial efforts to experimentally and theoretically reproduce the buzzworthy result have come up short, and researchers remain deeply sceptical.", "The research team, led by Sukbae Lee and Ji-Hoon Kim at the start-up firm Quantum Energy Research Centre in Seoul said in preprints published on 25 July1,2 that a compound of copper, lead, phosphorus and oxygen, dubbed LK-99, is a superconductor at ambient pressure and temperatures above 127 \u00b0C (400 Kelvin). The team claims that samples show two key signs of superconductivity: zero electrical resistance and the Meissner effect, in which the material expels magnetic fields, leading samples to levitate above a magnet. Previous efforts have achieved superconductivity only in certain materials under incredibly low temperatures or extremely high pressures. No material has ever been confirmed to be a superconductor under ambient conditions.", "LK-99\u2019s purported superconductivity drew immediate scrutiny from scientists. \u201cMy first impression was \u2018no.\u2019\u201d says Inna Vishik, a condensed matter experimentalist at the University of California, Davis. \u201cThese \u2018Unidentified Superconducting Objects\u2019, as they\u2019re sometimes called, reliably show up on the arXiv. There\u2019s a new one every year or so.\u201d Advances in superconductivity are often touted for their potential practical impact on technologies such as computer chips and maglev trains, but Vishik points out that such excitement might be misplaced. Historically, progress in superconductivity has had tremendous benefits for basic science, but little in the way of everyday applications. There\u2019s no guarantee a material that is a room-temperature superconductor would be of practical use, Vishik says.", "The first attempts to replicate LK-99, reported in the past days, have not improved the material\u2019s prospects. None of the studies provide direct evidence for any superconductivity in the material. (The Korean team did not respond to Nature\u2019s request for comment.)", "Two separate experimental efforts by teams at the National Physical Laboratory of India in New Delhi3 and Beihang University in Beijing4, reported synthesizing LK-99, but did not observe signs of superconductivity.

Thing is, the scientific community isn't so sure they will be. Superconductors are absolutely key to devices such as quantum computers. They're used to form the fundamental qubit, which requires immeasurably tight operating conditions in order to produce accurate results. The issue is that we don't know of any materials that act as superconductors that don't also require extremely cool, sub-space temperatures to do so. Therein lies one problem with superconductors and their wider use today. But superconductors have many properties that are extremely important. They're absolutely energy efficient, in theory, requiring no cooling for electrical conductivity. In this popular Tweet (X, sorry) thread from Alex Kaplan, a frozen coffee connoisseur and Princeton Physics graduate, he explains how a valid room temperature superconductor could enable lossless energy transfer, enable new nuclear fusion concepts, create incredible batteries, make entirely efficient computer chips, and even make MRI machines and MagLev trains cheaper and easier. You can see then why a material that operates as a superconductor at room temperatures, or thereabouts, is perhaps a little exciting.  The paper lays out a superconductor called LK-99. It's easy to produce, likely mass manufacturable, and works at both ambient temperature and pressure. But there's a catch. I've trawled through the reaction to the announcement from the scientific community and found that some are initially sceptical about the claims made in the paper. Firstly, the paper's finding are yet to be replicated, which will be the watershed moment for any of its claims. Then there's the news editor for the famed scientific publication New Scientist, Jacob Aron, mentioning that they're looking into this and \"Spoiler: it's very likely nothing.\"  Ouch, that stings.

This paper was subsequently retracted due to alleged data fabrication. That 2021 paper is not directly linked to this one, and has no impact on its ratification, but it does show that any claim to this sort of incredible breakthrough has to be taken with heaps of salt until it's widely proven to be true.

Policymakers Should Care about Room-Temperature Superconductors | The National Interest", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/08/03/lk-99-science-breakthrough-maybe/", "text": "A recent discovery has the potential to unleash a world of energy abundance, floating trains, and geopolitical transformation. A recent development has rocked the scientific community over the past two weeks. Advocates proclaim that we now potentially stand on the brink of a transformative age in technology that could render our current power network and level of technology as quaintly outdated as the telegraph. The harbinger of this new age? Room-temperature superconductors\u2014materials that conduct electricity with perfect efficiency, without the need for deep chilling. If viable, then the arrival of these superconductors is not just a technological leap; it\u2019s a paradigm shift with significant implications for the economy, national security and defense policy, and the future of energy consumption. First, however, we must determine whether these superconductors can truly be made. Policymakers and experts ought to be aware of the currently unfolding events. The Quest for the Holy Grail Let\u2019s start with some basic science. A superconductor, as the name suggests, is a material that can conduct electricity with zero resistance. In other words, it allows an electric current to flow indefinitely without any loss of energy. Compare this to say, contemporary batteries, which can lose up to 25 percent of stored energy over time. If that sounds astounding, that\u2019s because it is. However, this magic comes with a caveat: traditional superconductors only function in high-pressure, low-temperature environments akin to those found in the deepest recesses of outer space, thus limiting their practical application. Enter room-temperature superconductors. As the name indicates, these are superconductors that operate at temperatures you would typically find in your everyday environment. The quest for this radical development has been ongoing for decades, with physicists and material scientists around the globe drawn to this scientific holy grail like bees to honey. As of late last month, it appears that the grail may\u2014just may\u2014have been found. A group of South Korean scientists published papers claiming that they had developed a room-temperature, standard atmospheric pressure superconductor utilizing a lead-based material now dubbed \u201cLK-99.\u201d The scientists\u2019 results have supposedly been successfully replicated by Chinese researchers. Other physicists around the world are racing to see if they too can create functioning LK-99. A preprint from Sin\u00e9ad M. Griffin, a physicist from Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, provides an explanation of what the South Korean scientists have seen. Yet other efforts to reproduce the results have predominantly fallen short. The School of Materials Science and Engineering at Beihang University in China attempted to replicate the LK-99 team\u2019s process but encountered different outcomes. Likewise, a team at the National Physical Laboratory of India also failed. The jury is thus still out on whether or not LK-99 is indeed a viable room-temperature superconductor\u2014we are still extremely early in the scientific investigative process. We must wait until respected national laboratories, institutions, and others more thoroughly experiment with the process. We simply will not know for days, perhaps even weeks, whether LK-99 is in fact the real thing. Even if it isn\u2019t, however, current results indicate that, at the very least, the compound\u2019s discovery \u201csuggests new lines of research\u201d into room-temperature superconductors. A Scientific Revolution\u2026 But let us suppose, for a moment, that LK-99 is indeed the real thing. Or, at the very least, that there is now theoretical evidence that room-temperature superconductors are possible and we\u2019ll have the real thing developed within a decade or so. If so, why should this matter to us? The answer is that the potential applications of this new superconductor, if viable, are nothing short of revolutionary. Our current electrical grid leaks enormous amounts of energy as heat due to resistance in wires. Now envision a world where electrical power grids lose virtually no energy in transmission. Room-temperature superconductors could lead to \u201cperfect\u201d power lines, supercharging the efficiency of our power infrastructure, slashing energy costs in the billions of dollars, reducing carbon footprints, and invigorating the growth of renewable energy. Moreover, smaller, more efficient electrical equipment is possible. Think electric vehicles with dramatically improved range, or data centers consuming less power. Further radical effects would be felt in various fields. In transportation, the introduction of room-temperature superconductors could herald the advent of high-speed, magnetically levitated trains that whizz along at blistering speeds with unmatched energy efficiency\u2014New York City to Los Angeles in twenty minutes flat. This could revolutionize both intercity travel and freight delivery, dramatically reducing commute and delivery times while making a significant dent in transportation-related emissions. In the realm of information technology, these superconductors could catalyze the development of quantum computers. The technology, while still in its nascent stages, promises computational capabilities that make today\u2019s most powerful supercomputers seem rudimentary. With room-temperature superconductors, this could become commonplace\u2014comparable with the equivalent of the most advanced modern supercomputer being condensed into the size of a smartphone In medicine, room-temperature superconductors would turbocharge existing high-tech applications. Regulator superconductors are already used here; they are the hidden champions powering Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scanners, allowing doctors to peer inside the human body in unprecedented detail, all without a single incision. Yet these require cryogenic temperatures to function. Room-temperature superconductors would, in the words of one engineer, \u201cmake MRI\u2019s both more accessible, affordable, and also increase resolution to the sub micro-meter scale. Autodocs for all.\u201d In short, the impact of room-temperature superconductors would likely be seismic. The advent of these superconductors could usher in an era of unprecedented industrial growth, igniting the birth of entirely new industries, driving economic growth, and generating millions of jobs in sectors ranging from technology and transportation to energy and healthcare. The companies that harness this transformative technology could emerge as global economic powerhouses. \u2026and a Geopolitical Revolution? But perhaps the greatest impact lies in the realm of national security, defense, and foreign policy. Military systems depend heavily on electricity, from aircraft carriers down to the individual soldier\u2019s gear. Room-temperature superconductors could mean more efficient and compact power systems, lighter and longer-lasting batteries, and more powerful radar and sonar systems. The U.S. military\u2019s ability to project power around the globe would be significantly enhanced, as would its ability to sustain operations in remote areas. Moreover, as the military becomes more electrified and networked, the vulnerability of its power infrastructure becomes a critical concern. Superconducting cables are resistant to many types of disruption and could theoretically even be designed to automatically \u201cheal\u201d after a break, greatly improving the resilience of the military\u2019s power networks. More broadly, room-temperature superconductors could reshape global geopolitical dynamics by altering the strategic significance of energy resources. If room-temperature superconductors lead to cheaper, more efficient storage and transmission of renewable energy, nations with abundant renewable resources could gain a strategic advantage. Oil-dependent economies could find their power waning. Yet a superconductive world is not without its significant risks. The potential military applications of room-temperature superconductors could lead to a new technological arms race. Governments across the globe would quickly recognize the strategic importance of this technology and rush to stake their claim, leading to international disputes over patents, technology transfers, and market access. There are significant national security implications if other nations master this technology first, or if the United States fails to secure its supply chains for the requisite critical materials needed to make room-temperature superconductors. This is not a prospect to be taken lightly, and policymakers must factor in these considerations while shaping policies. When the Magic Becomes Real The quest for room-temperature superconductors thus paints a tantalizing picture of a future that may be within our grasp\u2014one where energy flows freely without loss, high-speed trains levitate on invisible magnetic tracks, and quantum computers hum in offices worldwide. Washington could perhaps speed up this transformation through a variety of means: increased funding for research and development, tax incentives for companies investing in superconductor technology, and strategic public-private partnerships that share the financial risks and rewards of this ground-breaking technology. But the superconductive moment, such as it is, also presents us with a formidable challenge: how to harness the transformative potential of this technology while navigating the geopolitical tensions and policy challenges it presents. The superconductive transition would be massively disruptive, with entire industries falling prey to technological change, oil-rich and technologically-poor nations suddenly falling behind, and new dangers manifesting. The balance that must be struck is a delicate one, melding the drive for economic growth and technological superiority with the pursuit of international cooperation and sustainable progress. It is incumbent that policymakers be extremely careful in this effort. Ultimately, time will tell whether LK-99 is the real deal; a viable room temperature superconductor, with all that such implies. It is also incredibly ironic that the South Korean scientists behind LK-99 used lead. Perhaps the ancient alchemists were right all along: lead can be transformed into gold.

Read more Aug 3 (Reuters) - Last week, two papers by South Korean scientists made an extraordinary claim that sparked a social media frenzy and pushed up prices of some stocks in China and South Korea: the discovery of a practical superconductor. Superconductors are materials that allow electrical current to flow with no resistance, a property that would revolutionize power grids where energy is lost in transmission as well as advance fields such as computing chips, where electrical resistance acts as a speed limit. The papers, which appeared on a website used by scientists to share research before formal peer review and publication, spurred researchers around the world - including in at least two U.S. national labs and three Chinese universities - to take a closer look at the proposed material. Superconducting materials already exist in places like MRI machines for medical imaging and some quantum computers, but only display their superconducting properties at extremely low temperatures, making them impractical for wide use. The South Korean researchers last week said they found a superconductor that works at room temperature, which has long been considered a holy grail for scientists in the field. The researchers also published a recipe for making the material - dubbed LK-99 - which involves taking a relatively common mineral called lead apatite and introducing a small number of copper atoms into it. The South Korean researchers published two papers - one initial paper with three authors and a second, more detailed paper with six authors that included only two of the authors from the first paper. None of the authors contacted by Reuters responded to a request for comment. Physicists interviewed by Reuters said the good news is that there is no law of physics that says a room temperature superconductor cannot exist, and the material described by the South Korean team is easy to grow, meaning other researchers should be able to start getting results as soon as this week. The gold standard for proof of discovery is other labs reliably replicating the South Korean researchers' findings. Researchers from at least three Chinese universities have in recent days said they produced versions of LK-99 with varying results. One team from the Huazhong University of Science and Technology posted a video purporting to show the material levitating over a magnet, which is important because true superconductors can float over a magnet in any orientation, without spinning like a compass. But another team, from Qufu Normal University, said they did not observe zero resistance, one of required characteristics of a superconductor. A third, from the Southeast University in the eastern Chinese city of Nanjing, said they measured zero resistance, but only at a temperature of 110 Kelvin (-163 degree Celsius). On Thursday, South Korean experts said they would set up a committee to verify the claims. Eric Toone, a scientist-turned investor at Bill Gates\u2019 Breakthrough Energy Ventures, said he is monitoring any peer review and reproduction efforts by reputable labs. \"The measurements you need to verify or to demonstrate superconductivity are very difficult to make,\" said Toone. \"It's completely game changing if it's right, but until we have more validation, we just have to be patient.\" The possible bad news for LK-99 is that the superconducting field is full of materials that hold promise at first but fall apart under scrutiny. Researchers even have a handy name for them - unidentified superconducting objects. \"We call them USOs,\" said Mike Norman, a condensed matter physicist at Argonne National Laboratory. \"There's a long history of USOs going a long way back, including some very famous people who thought they had a superconductor and they didn't. It's like anything in science - you can be fooled. Even good people can be fooled.\" Norman said the original papers had problems. Some may have been honest typographical mistakes from rushing to post the research, but more troubling was a lack of data over a broad temperature range to show how the material behaves when it is in a superconducting state and when it is not. \"People often use that method to show how much of the sample is actually a superconductor and how much of it is not,\" Norman said. Other researchers have also found reasons for caution. Sin\u00e9ad Griffin, a solid-state physicist and staff scientist Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, used a U.S. Department of Energy supercomputer to simulate the proposed material. Griffin found that inserting copper atoms into lead apatite caused the material's atoms to rearrange in an unexpected way that resembles existing superconductors. But that effect depends on the copper atoms going to a spot that they don't naturally want to go, which could make it harder to produce the material in bulk quantities. Griffin cautioned that her simulation has limits - it cannot conclusively prove that the material is a superconductor, and the work assumed that researchers can place copper atoms into the lead apatite with perfect precision. In the real world, that's unlikely and could have a big effect on the material. And even if LK-99 does turn out to be a room temperature superconductor, it will still take time to determine how useful it might be, said Michael Fuhrer, a professor of physics at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia. For example, Fuhrer said no data was provided on how much electrical current the material might be able to carry and still be a superconductor, a key question for improving power grids. Still, Fuhrer and other physicists said the results are worth studying given all that remains unknown about superconductors and the possibility that they could be discovered serendipitously in a common material. \"There's lots and lots of minerals out there that we haven't looked at yet,\" said Argonne's Norman. \"And there's probably some very interesting physics hiding in these minerals.\" Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

layout Site theme John Timmer\n    -  Aug 4, 2023 2:07 pm UTC In late July, a couple of startling papers appeared on the arXiv, a repository of pre-peer-review manuscripts on topics in physics and astronomy. The papers claim to describe the synthesis of a material that is not only able to superconduct above room temperature, but also above the boiling point of water. And it does so at normal atmospheric pressures. Instead of having to build upon years of work with exotic materials that only work under extreme conditions, the papers seem to describe a material that could be made via some relatively straightforward chemistry and would work if you set it on your desk. It was like finding a shortcut to a material that would revolutionize society. The perfect time to write an article on those results would be when they've been confirmed by multiple labs. But these are not perfect times. Instead, rumors seem to be flying daily about possible confirmation, confusing and contradictory results, and informed discussions of why this material either should or shouldn't work. In this article, we'll explain where things stand and why getting to a place of clarity will be challenging, even if these claims are right. The more detailed of the two manuscripts describes how to make the material and measurements of its property. The material itself is a variation of a well-known chemical called lead apatite. Apatites are a class of chemicals that form similar crystal structures; this particular version is primarily composed of lead and phosphate groups\u2014all of its constituents are cheap and readily available. The version developed here, which has been termed LK-99, was made by reacting a lead sulfate with a copper-phosphorus compound (the reaction requires high temperatures for over a day under a vacuum). This strips the phosphorus from the copper, oxidizes it, and allows it to displace the sulfur from its compound with the lead. Critically, though, some fraction of the lead itself ends up replaced by copper in the resulting compound. This has a significant impact on the apatite crystal structure because copper is quite a bit smaller than lead. The researchers claim the overall volume of the sample drops by about half of a percentage as a result, and that change is accompanied by shifts in the orientation of various atoms and bonds. That means changes in where the electrons reside within the material. That change appears to be critical to the LK-99's behavior. Superconductivity is associated with a number of very specific properties, and the researchers measure two of them: the expulsion of magnetic field lines (called the Meissner effect) and the existence of a critical temperature at which conductivity changes. It's hard to explain just how strange these experiments are. Under normal circumstances, the superconducting material starts out behaving as a normal chemical and has to be cooled down to the critical point where exceptional behavior emerges. LK-99, by contrast, starts out superconducting and has to be heated beyond the boiling point of water to reach its critical temperature. The only somewhat strange result here comes at temperatures just below the critical temperature. At room temperature and above, the resistance of LK-99 remains at zero as far as the testing equipment is able to measure. But it starts to rise ever so slightly once temperatures reach 60\u00b0C and displays a smooth upward slope until the sample hits 90\u00b0C, at which point it stays flat until the critical temperature is reached. The researchers did not attempt to explain this. Join the Ars Orbital Transmission mailing list to get weekly updates delivered to your inbox.

Here\u2019s how it works. Zero resistance is replicated, but room temperature operation is not. The scientific community is still scrambling to confirm\u00a0the recent revolutionary claim\u00a0by Korean scientists that they have created a room-temperature, ambient-pressure superconductor. But with enough brainpower looking into the subject of the LK-99 material, it's bound to be a matter of time before the superconductivity claims are fully confirmed or denied. Once again, researchers in China seem to be at the forefront: today, scientists with the Physics Department of Southeast University, a top university in Nanjing, China, have reported measuring zero electrical resistance, a key requirement for superconductivity, in a sample of LK-99 they produced from scratch. However, that comes with the caveat that they could only achieve the properties at -163C, not at the room temperature touted by the original paper.\u00a0As with other efforts from other teams, two of which claim to have confirmed certain other aspects of the claimed superconducting breakthrough, the new results from the Southeast University team are preliminary \u2014 the team is still studying different methods of fabricating the material, with plans to provide more results in the future. Other research teams are also still working to replicate the initial claims. \u22c7 16 Teams Race to Validate Superconductor Breakthrough, Find Mixed Results\n\n\u22c7 Superconductor Levitates At Room Temperature, But Questions Remain\n\n\u22c7 Superconductor Breakthrough Findings Replicated, Twice, in Preliminary Testing After having successfully synthesized LK-99, which they say was purer than the samples the original Korean time achieved, the Chinese research team helmed by Doctor Sun Yue looked into the material's conductive properties, finding some \"very interesting electronic properties of this material.\"\u00a0As a reminder, LK-99 is a compound of lanarkite [Pb\u2082SO\u2085] and copper phosphide [Cu\u2083P] baked within a 4-day, multi-step, small batch, solid-state synthesis process that was nevertheless also achieved over a Russian kitchen counter. In this case, the \"very interesting electronic properties\" refer to the material's ability to conduct electricity without any resistance \u2014 leading to incredible efficiency savings that could get PC enthusiasts something like that 30 GHz processor Intel promised but never delivered. The above video shows the researcher explaining the findings. Using a four-point probe method, the scientists measured their synthesized LK-99 at 0 resistance at an ambient temperature of 110K (-163 \u00ba C) and at normal air pressure. They also verified that LK-99 transitioned in and out of its zero resistance state depending on whether it was subject to a strong electric field, another hallmark of superconductivity. Here's a summation of the team's findings, taken from the Wikipedia live-tracker page: \"Claimed to have synthesized LK-99 and to have measured superconductivity up to a temperature of 110 kelvin. Claimed to have observed an abrupt drop in resistance between ~300K and 220K, aligning with the Korean LKK team's results. Claimed to have confirmed structural consistency with x-ray diffraction.\" The confirmed absence of electrical resistance now comes together with yesterday's news that confirmed at least one-half of the superconducting equation was solved: LK-99 showcased the Meissner effect (originally Meissner-Ochsenfeld), which results in the levitation of materials as they interact with the Meissner-effect-induced magnetic field. And now, it seems the other half of the equation, resistance-less electrical conduction, was verified in LK-99.\n\nBut questions remain even here: it seems that LK-99 only shows superconductivity at 110 kelvin (-163C), which disputes the \"room-temperature\" bit originally claimed (although all tech enthusiasts that have dabbled in liquid nitrogen cooling know that 110 kelvin is handleable, if not practical). It's also unclear why LK-99 would show both diamagnetism (responsible for levitation) and superconductivity, but within different temperature bands \u2014 expectations would paint it more as a \"buy one, get two\" promotion. Yet one plus one generally being equal to two, we seem to have independent confirmation of several facets of a superconducting compound being successfully synthesized. But while this is incredibly promising news, there are still caveats. For one: it's strange that two teams verified different halves of the superconducting requirements, but no team has successfully verified both (as of the time of writing). You would think that it would make more sense for one side to take more time to crack than the other; otherwise, why didn't the initial Meissner-effect observation also show the hallmarks of zero electrical resistance? What is stopping these teams of extremely talented individuals from achieving what others before them did in full? In the video, Professor Yue himself says that while promising, the team's results aren't proof that LK-99 is the superconductor breakthrough we've been waiting for. For that to happen, you'd have to wait for a credible institution to confirm both the Meissner effect and the zero electrical resistance halves of the equation \u2014 at the same time. And even then, it won't be enough: their announcement (cue all other scientific prizes) will have to be followed up by other institutions up to a point where there's enough overlap in the results that says: \"This is more than fabricated data or a mere fluke\". And that's not saying anything of all the sweet spots this material needs to hit to be the hero we want it to be. It has to be abundant enough and easy enough to access that it's relatively cheap to mine; then it has to be relatively cheap to process and synthesize at a mass scale; and then it still has to be turned into actually useable bits of electronics that are compatible enough with our current fabrication methods. Talk about high standards; that's years of work right there. For now, LK-99 seems to have some limitations. It's currently hard to synthesize at high purities (because it only happens in very specific areas of the compound), meaning yield is likely to be poor. And in fact, perhaps this purity problem (acknowledged in the original paper) is the root of most of these issues: scientists have had a difficult time creating enough quantities of the material that display any of the superconducting or diamagnetic features. There could be unknown factors at play at a chemistry level that explain the low yield, but if that's true, then we can't really trust the replicability of the results just yet. Another limitation is that the material could be one-dimensional - meaning that it only presents superconductivity on a section of it, which could be why the levitation in the original video wasn't even.\u00a0That still means a load of possible applications while unlocking new ones \u2014 it's never a pure loss. For now, the jury is still out on the original Korean teams' claims of a room-temperature superconductor, and the Southeast University researchers will continue to study the new material and fabrication methods as they search to find the correct mixture to replicate the room-temperature superconductor. For now, some claims have been preliminarily confirmed, while others remain out of reach. Several other teams are also racing to validate the paper, so we're sure to learn more over the coming days.

For a video with the potential to change the world, \u201cMagnetic Property Test of LK-99 Film\u201d has disappointingly few views on YouTube: barely 240,000 views in the last five months. It lasts all of 47 seconds and shows a chip of metal, coated with a material called LK-99, being repelled by both poles of a magnet held by a gloved hand. Without context, it\u2019s mystifying; a cat video has more obvious appeal. If LK-99 is what it claims to be, though, that video will be enshrined as a historical artifact. The researchers at Quantum Energy Research Center in Seoul, who first made LK-99, have argued that it demonstrates some properties of superconductivity. One of them is the diamagnetism shown in the YouTube video. But as squads of scientists around the world race to replicate those results, the jury is still out on whether LK-99 is a true superconductor: a material that offers no resistance at all to electricity. To be precise, the storm of excitement (or perhaps hype) is over LK-99's potential to be a room-temperature superconductor. Many other superconductors exist, and indeed are in use already\u2014in MRI machines, for example. But their superconductivity shows up only in very low temperatures or under very high pressures. The superconductors in MRI machines have to be cooled with liquid helium to a temperature of -269\u00b0C. A superconductor that works in ordinary, ambient temperatures and pressures will undoubtedly be revolutionary (more on that below). But just as fascinating as the science of it all is the discourse around the science, which has unfolded breathlessly on social media and the rest of the internet. Prediction markets took bets on whether LK-99 is legit. arXiv, the database of scientific papers, filled up with preprints about superconductivity. There were memes, naturally. Stocks in Chinese and Korean tech companies surged. Everyone seemed absolutely primed and ready for a silver bullet that will solve the world\u2019s problems. To be sure, the world has many problems that need solving. But it\u2019s telling that we, as a society, seem to be craving technological miracles to do the job, as if scientific backwardness has been the only thing holding us back from a cleaner planet or a more equitable world. An air of desperation hangs over us as we lunge with open arms at \u201cgame-changing,\u201d \u201crevolutionary,\u201d \u201cthe-world-will-never-be-the-same-again\u201d developments. Recall that it was AI not very long ago, and the metaverse before that, and decentralized finance before that, and Crispr before that. Even during the pandemic, health authorities had to warn us often that covid vaccines would not be silver bullets. There\u2019s a distinct danger in believing that new technology will rescue us and make us whole, and that we only need to wait for it to emerge. It induces us to ignore the changes we need to make today. New investments in public transport cannot be postponed until cheap maglev trains are a reality. The future prospects of carbon capture or atmospheric manipulation shouldn\u2019t stop us from cutting fossil fuel use today. LK-99, or some other material, may well prove to be an ideal, inexpensive room temperature semiconductor, and that will certainly be a red-letter day. But progress comes only at the speed of human effort. The scientists behind LK-99, after all, have been working on the material for a quarter of a century. Five potential applications for a true room-temperature semiconductor: Not very long ago, the only access we had to a giant scientific discovery was to read about it in a peer-reviewed journal. Now, no longer: Besides the fact that the original LK-99 papers themselves appeared in non peer-reviewed \u201cpreprint\u201d form on arXiv, we\u2019re also getting an unprecedented kind of access through social media to the scientific work surrounding LK-99. That\u2019s in part because LK-99 is easy to make, at least for an alleged superconductor. There are videos, for instance\u2014not only from the team that made LK-99 but also from scientists around the world trying to replicate their results, filming and uploading their trials on Twitter, Twitch, or the Chinese site Bilibili. Individuals and institutions are live-tweeting their experiments. One scientist tweeted out her arXiv paper barely a day after it was submitted, accompanied by a gif of Barack Obama dropping a mic. One way to see this is  as the democratization of science. Another frame for it, though, is as a performance of science for the public. There\u2019s a reason that scientists trying to replicate the original results are posting videos of near-levitating flakes of LK-99. Levitation is not the chief attribute of interest with superconductivity, but sure does look cool. In contrast, there is still little evidence that LK-99 has zero resistance to electric currents. (Preliminary papers from two Chinese universities found high resistance\u00a0and zero resistance around -173\u00b0C but not conclusively at room temperature.) This data is necessarily technical and textual; it doesn\u2019t lend itself as easily to social media posts.

Here\u2019s how it works. Two different universities have shown LK-99 floating in the air. The worldwide scientific community is still working around the clock to verify claims of a new superconductor that might yet revolutionize human civilization. Now, we have two pretty convincing videos showing the substance floating in the air. Scientists with the Huazhong University of Science and Technology claim to have replicated LK-99's levitation abilities at room temperature, which they showcased in a video uploaded to Bilibili. And Zhang Chiang, from Wuhan University also in China, has uploaded a new video as of Saturday. This is an encouraging sign: one of superconductivity's hallmarks, magnetism due to the Meissner effect, seems to be a replicable feature of the copper-lead-apatite compound. If only it were \"that easy\" to confirm (and understand) the material's zero electric resistance capability and how it manifests. \u22c7 16 Teams Race to Validate Superconductor Breakthrough, Find Mixed Results \u22c7 Scramble to Validate Superconductor Breakthrough Confirms Zero Resistance, With a Catch \u22c7 Superconductor Breakthrough Findings Replicated, Twice, in Preliminary Testing The first video below comes from the scientists at the Huazhong University of Science and Technology and, though it's hard to see, there's a small black substance that's allegedly LK-99. The second video, uploaded to Billibilli by Zhang Chiang, an assistant engineer and doctoral student at the Department of Metallurgical Engineering and Materials of Wuhan University of Science and Technology, showcases what\u2019s claimed to be an LK-99 flake showcasing one crucial aspect of a superconductor\u2019s levitation: flux pinning. The Wuhan University video showcases an LK-99 flake levitating above a powerful magnet. But levitation itself isn\u2019t a sure-sign of a superconductor: most metallic elements showcase diamagnetism by themselves. What differentiates a superconductor\u2019s levitation is that it exhibits flux pinning - an emergent levitation capability that occurs as the pre-existing magnetic field (from the lower magnet) interacts with the superconductor. The way to differentiate between diamagnetic and flux-pin levitation is that in \u201cnormal\u201d levitation, the floating object can be disturbed by outside forces, including gravity - this leads to a floating rock that just can\u2019t seem to stand still, as it glides, balances and wobbles above an ever-changing tug-of-war between it, the magnetic field, and external forces (such as a gust of air, for instance). Flux pinning, however, pins the magnetic field lines within the superconductor itself. Type-II superconductors (such as LK-99 appears to be) feature internal magnetic vortices; flux pinning happens when the bottom magnet\u2019s own magnetic field (which is actually quantized, that is, discretely composed of impossibly thin action lines, and not a formless cloud) interacts with these magnetic vortices and pinning centers are created. As the word implies, these centers \u201cpin\u201d the interaction between forces, locking the levitating superconductor in place. In the Wuhan University video, this is seen as the LK-99 flake stays pretty much locked in position above the magnet, despite being poked with the external, probing force of a simple pen The clear-cut update is this: despite the fact the researchers could replicate LK-99's levitation at room temperature, there's still no successful replication of the announced room-temperature LK-99 superconductivity. For that to happen, both the Meissner-effect magnetic field and zero electric resistance are required from the same sample. And while scientists have previously shown that LK-99 does have zero resistivity at -163C, they haven't yet proven it has those properties at room temperature. So what we're left with (still) is several failed or partially failed replications - and a whole world of additional knowledge on LK-99. The Wikipedia live tracker is one of the best places for anyone looking for up-to-date information on the (public) replication processes currently underway.\n\nThe replication difficulties and the nebulous history around superconductors (which have seen several similar room-temperature superconductor claims announced, published, and retracted) combine into a visible, waving, giant red flag. So remember to remove your rose-colored glasses. LK-99 is a fickle thing, and the ground it's standing on is filled with question-shaped potholes. As our understanding of LK-99 improves, the fuzzy road ahead become slightly clearer. Unfortunately, it seems that the material's characteristics themselves may both be its boon and its blight. That's not to mention the fact that the original scientists did a shoddy job of documenting how they created the material, leaving scientists to patch together samples with a somewhat incomplete cookbook. As we've explored before, LK-99 is a compound made from reacting lead sulfate with a copper-phosphorous compound. The process through which this compound becomes LK-99 requires that the materials be baked at high temperatures for around 24 hours in a vacuum. This is slightly easier to achieve than it sounds, as several Twitter/X posts and videos of people \"owning their own LK-99\" will show you (there's also the eternal memory of a Russian soil scientist and her kitchen counter as the first claimed independent synthetization of LK-99). And adding great to good, the materials aren't even expensive to procure \u2014 the materials are all relatively cheap and abundant. But the biggest problem with LK-99 doesn't seem to involve its synthetization; the problem is the lack of control over the chemistry and quantum processes that occur during the fabrication process itself.\n\nCrystals, it turns out, are fickle things. And the way LK-99 seemingly becomes a superconductor has to do with how many lead particles are replaced by copper. As it stands, it seems that the more copper that replaces lead in the final mixture, the purer the resulting compound is (which translates into it showcasing both the emergent levitation courtesy of the Meissner and zero resistance to electrical conductivity). But that is both the solution and the problem; for now, there's no way for researchers to know what the synthetization process will actually do at an atomic level. So the scenario we're arriving at is that sometimes, there may simply not be enough superconducting elements in a given LK-99 batch for it to showcase any of the superconductive properties we're all hoping it does. It's actually in the formula: the \"x\" values in Pb10-xCux(PO4)6O, as it's represented in chemistry parlance, mean that it's uncertain just how many of the 10 base lead atoms are replaced with copper atoms. But it seems that the higher the number, the better. To complicate things even further, however, it's not just a case of having as many copper atoms replace lead as possible; the places where these substitutions occur in the crystal also matter. It seems that some locations are better for unlocking LK-99's superconducting capabilities than others, and for now, once again, we have no way to \"pick and choose\" what happens during the synthetization process. Adding insult to injury, the same LK-99 batch can have different ratios of copper atoms replacing lead across its volume. Some will be high, which is good for levitation and bringing a twinkle of excitement to our eyes; some will be low, resulting in a mostly inert compound that would be better used as a doorstop. And that's saying nothing about how even the most random and seemingly insignificant variances in any of the synthetization steps can introduce unknown variables into replication attempts themselves \u2014 especially when researchers are following already badly-documented processes. Cue the number of failed replication attempts, which, if all this pans out, is likely to keep increasing until it comes to a point where we can design a new synthetization process that improves yield. With all these moving parts, however, it's no wonder we're still walking across a dark room. It\u2019s still likely that the LK-99 saga will end in disappointment, despite all the lessons and science data being collected and worked on as a result of this. Perhaps it\u2019ll truly happen as some have said (and we ourselves did), in that this discovery will follow the path of cold-fusion. Even if it does, all lessons learned here will inform our future - and the upside is simply too great for us not to try.

magnet.", "But levitation itself isn\u2019t a sure-sign of a superconductor: most metallic elements showcase diamagnetism by themselves.", "What differentiates a superconductor\u2019s levitation is that it exhibits flux pinning - an emergent levitation capability that occurs as the pre-existing magnetic field (from the lower magnet) interacts with the superconductor.", "The way to differentiate between diamagnetic and flux-pin levitation is that in \u201cnormal\u201d levitation, the floating object can be disturbed by outside forces, including gravity - this leads to a floating rock that just can\u2019t seem to stand still, as it glides, balances and wobbles above an ever-changing tug-of-war between it, the magnetic field, and external forces (such as a gust of air, for instance).", "Flux pinning, however, pins the magnetic field lines within the superconductor itself.", "Type-II superconductors (such as LK-99 appears to be) feature internal magnetic vortices; flux pinning happens when the bottom magnet\u2019s own magnetic field (which is actually quantized, that is, discretely composed of impossibly thin action lines, and not a formless cloud) interacts with these magnetic vortices and pinning centers are created.", "As the word implies, these centers \u201cpin\u201d the interaction between forces, locking the levitating superconductor in place.", "In the Wuhan University video, this is seen as the LK-99 flake stays pretty much locked in position above the magnet, despite being poked with the external, probing force of a simple pen", "The clear-cut update is this: despite the fact the researchers could replicate LK-99's levitation at room temperature, there's still no successful replication of the announced room-temperature LK-99 superconductivity.", "For that to happen, both the Meissner-effect magnetic field and zero electric resistance are required from the same sample.", "And while scientists have previously shown that LK-99 does have zero resistivity at -163C, they haven't yet proven it has those properties at room temperature.", "So what we're left with (still) is several failed or partially failed replications - and a whole world of additional knowledge on LK-99.", "The Wikipedia live tracker is one of the best places for anyone looking for up-to-date information on the (public) replication processes currently underway.", "The replication difficulties and the nebulous history around superconductors (which have seen several similar room-temperature superconductor claims announced, published, and retracted) combine into a visible, waving, giant red flag.", "So remember to remove your rose-colored glasses.", "LK-99 is a fickle thing, and the ground it's standing on is filled with question-shaped potholes.", "As our understanding of LK-99 improves, the fuzzy road ahead become slightly clearer.", "Unfortunately, it seems that the material's characteristics themselves may both be its boon and its blight.", "That's not to mention the fact that the original scientists did a shoddy job of documenting how they created the material, leaving scientists to patch together samples with a somewhat incomplete cookbook.", "As we've explored before, LK-99 is a compound made from reacting lead sulfate with a copper-phosphorous compound.", "The process through which this compound becomes LK-99 requires that the materials be baked at high temperatures for around 24 hours in a vacuum.", "This is slightly easier to achieve than it sounds, as several Twitter/X posts and videos of people \"owning their own LK-99\" will show you (there's also the eternal memory of a Russian soil scientist and her kitchen counter as the first claimed independent synthetization of LK-99).", "And adding great to good, the materials aren't even expensive to procure \u2014 the materials are all relatively cheap and abundant.", "But the biggest problem with LK-99 doesn't seem to involve its synthetization; the problem is the lack of control over the chemistry and quantum processes that occur during the fabrication process itself.", "Crystals, it turns out, are fickle things.", "And the way LK-99 seemingly becomes a superconductor has to do with how many lead particles are replaced by copper.", "As it stands, it seems that the more copper that replaces lead in the final mixture, the purer the resulting compound is (which translates into it showcasing both the emergent levitation courtesy of the Meissner and zero resistance to electrical conductivity).", "But that is both the solution and the problem; for now, there's no way for researchers to know what the synthetization process will actually do at an atomic level.", "So the scenario we're arriving at is that sometimes, there may simply not be enough superconducting elements in a given LK-99 batch for it to showcase any of the superconductive properties we're all hoping it does.", "It's actually in the formula: the \"x\" values in Pb10-xCux(PO4)6O, as it's represented in chemistry parlance, mean that it's uncertain just how many of the 10 base lead atoms are replaced with copper atoms.", "But it seems that the higher the number, the better.", "To complicate things even further, however, it's not just a case of having as many copper atoms replace lead as possible; the places where these substitutions occur in the crystal also matter.", "It seems that some locations are better for unlocking LK-99's superconducting capabilities than others, and for now, once again, we have no way to \"pick and choose\" what happens during the synthetization process.", "Adding insult to injury, the same LK-99 batch can have different ratios of copper atoms replacing lead across its volume.", "Some will be high, which is good for levitation and bringing a twinkle of excitement to our eyes; some will be low, resulting in a mostly inert compound that would be better used as a doorstop.", "And that's saying nothing about
